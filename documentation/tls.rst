HTTPS
=====

This section is useful in case you plan to provide a HTTPS connection to the
users of the platform.

The TLS certificate has been installed with Certbot (https://certbot.eff.org).

The command to renew it each 90 days is:

.. code-block:: shell

    ./path/to/certbot-auto renew --quiet --no-self-upgrade



To enable the new certificate for Tomcat (the GeoServer app) you will need some
extra steps:

Create a keystore for Tomcat
----------------------------

.. code-block:: shell

    $ cp -L /etc/letsencrypt/live/shelter-database.org/fullchain.pem /home/shelter
    $ cp -L /etc/letsencrypt/live/shelter-database.org/privkey.pem /home/shelter
    $ openssl pkcs12 -export -in fullchain.pem -inkey privkey.pem -out fullchain_and_key.p12 -name tomcat


You will be asked to provide a password (called **yourPKCS12pass** in the
following). Do not forget it. You will need it for our second step.

Now that we have our PKCS12 keystore, we can use Javaâ€™s keytool to generate a
JKS from our PKCS12 file like so:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ keytool -importkeystore -deststorepass yourJKSpass -destkeypass yourKeyPass -destkeystore MyDSKeyStore.jks -srckeystore fullchain_and_key.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -srcstorepass yourPKCS12pass -alias tomcat


This will give you a file called MyDSKeyStore.jks.
Now you are ready to configure Tomcat for HTTPS.

Configure Tomcat for HTTPS
--------------------------

.. code-block:: shell

    <Connector port="8443" protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Protocol"
        URIEncoding="UTF-8" maxThreads="150" SSLEnabled="true" scheme="https"
        secure="true" clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS"
        keystoreFile="/home/shelter/MyDSKeyStore.jks"
        keystorePass="yourJKSpass" keyAlias="tomcat" keyPass="yourKeyPass"/>

Restart Tomcat and access Tomcat through HTTPS:
https://shelter-database.org:8443
