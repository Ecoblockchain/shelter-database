<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hundreds of thousands of shelters are built throughout the world every year in response to disasters, by a multitude of shelter actors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Confronted with the reality of rising numbers of disasters where sheltering presents a key component of the humanitarian assistance the Humanitarian Shelter Sector is challenged to deliver more, efficient and sustainable responses in very different contexts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Within the Red Cross Movement and other Organisations active in sheltering there exists extensive experience in the implementation of emergency, transitional and permanent shelters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">To consolidate and make available this knowledge the IFRC-SRU is tasked to build up an inventory of shelter solutions documented in a systematic, methodological manner that particularly captures technical details, construction practices, climatic conditions, availability and suitability of materials and techniques and other information for the planning process that helps save time and resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">The Shelter Database is conceived to be a resource for the wider shelter sector, that can help to deliver humanitarian shelter more time- and cost efficient and better adapted to the respective context. The collected data can also serve for technical analysis as well as longer term evaluation of shelter solutions and to identify and share best practices.<br /> The IFRC-SRU has the ambition to systematically map shelter projects in responses where the Shelter Cluster was activated and led by IFRC, however we invite all shelter actors to participate in building up this resource by entering their shelter project using the online format (to enter a shelter, create your profile under &#8220;join&#8221;).</span></p>
